## Motivation
UCSC's provided course planning tools are unhelpful and leave many students without the knowledge needed for successful course planning. This app brings all necessary information into one place to make the process of course planning fast and intuitive for students unfamiliar with their requirements. 



## How to run
Clone both the front end and back end repos
```
git clone https://github.com/waylonwilliams/ucsc-made-easy-backend.git
git clone https://github.com/nhi1e/ucsc-made-easy-frontend.git
```
Navigate to the front end repo in one terminal and run
```
npm i
npm run dev
```
In a new terminal, navigate to the back end repo and run
```
flask run
```
